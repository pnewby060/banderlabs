# Introduction #

TaskMan is a simple utility that allows you to view the tasks running on your Android device, and view what permissions a running task has. Optionally, you can force stop a task. To make sure you don't accidentily force stop important tasks, you can hide those from view.

**NOTE:** Android is not Windows Mobile. With modern versions of Android it should never be neccessary to forcefully terminate a task. Doing so can mean loss of data and might shorten your battery life. Unless a task is misbehaving badly, please let Android manage which tasks are running.
